    "## 1. Cel ćwiczenia\n",
    "\n",
    "Celem ćwiczenia jest modyfikacja zaproponowanej w bibliotece easyAI implementacji gry Nim, tak aby zawierała element losowy. Losowość polegać będzie na tym, że przy wykonywaniu ruchu jest 10. procentowe prawdopodobieństwo, że gracz bierze ze stosu o 1 element mniej niż zamierzał. Zmodyfikowana gra zostanie wielokrotnie uruchomiona (w wersjach deterministycznej i probabilistycznej) z dwoma graczami AI, dla dwóch różnych głębokości, a otrzymane wyniki (ilość wygranych, przegranych, remisów) porównane. Następnie gra zostanie wielokrotnie uruchomiona dla dwóch różnych algorytmów (Negamax z i bez odcięcia alfa-beta) z dwoma ustawieniami maksymalnej głębokości. Wyniki zostaną porównane, a dodatkowo policzony zostanie średni czas spędzony na wybraniu akcji przez każdy wariant AI."

    "## 2. Opis problemu\n",
    "\n",
    "Nim to gra dla dwóch osób z użyciem pinonków, które dzieli się na kupki dowolnej wielkości. Następnie gracze zabierają na zmianę dowolną, niezerową liczbę pionków. W jednym ruchu można zebrać tylko z jednej kupki. Wygrywa gracz, który zabiera ostatni pionek.\n",
    "\n",
    "Przez naturę samej gry, jeśli obaj gracze grają optymalnie, można z góry stwierdzić, który z nich wygra. W takim razie więc, jeśli dla zadanej planszy, 2 algorytmy AI będą grały optymalnie zawsze wygra ten sam. Czy tak się realnie stanie zobaczymy później, po wykonaniu testów. Dodanie element losowego powinno zatem zmienić wyniki, w stosunku do wariantu deterministycznego gry. Testy będziemy przeprowadzać dla stałej planszy, składającej się z 4 kupek pionków o odpowiednich ilościach: 2, 3, 4, 5."

Dlatego też gracze mają równą ilość wygranych gier. Inaczej sprawa ma się w przypadku gier probablistycznych. Wyniki graczy nie mają rozkładu 50/50.\n",
